# Web Developer 2000

My second attempt at a roguelike game, this time with a subject focused on software development and vulnerabilities. More content and gameplay can still be added, but it is finished for now in its current state. This was made as a midterm project for my Security and Vulnerabiltiy Assessments class.

## How to run the game

To get started, install python 3.7+ if not already installed. Then initialize a virtual python environment and activate it:

```bash
$ py -3.7 -m venv env
$ env\scripts\activate
```

Next, install required dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then simply run the game!

```bash
$ python main.py
```
